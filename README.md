The body mass index (BMI) is a measure used to quantify a person’s mass as well as interpret their body composition. It is defined as the mass (Kg) divided by height (m) squared.

Can you make a function that takes the person’s weight and height as input parameters and returns the BMI?
Call the function with some test values and print the outcome to the console.
Hint: Here’s the BMI calculation formula:

BMI = mass/(height * height) where mass and height are in metric units, kg and meter respectively


If the BMI is greater than 25, use the print statement to tell the user that they are overweight.
Otherwise, if the BMI is between 18.5 - 25, tell the user that they are of normal weight.
Finally, if their BMI is below 18.5, tell the user that they are underweight.
